## ⬇️ Installation 
The download is available via GitHub or by typing
```
git clone https://github.com/FraLiturri/NNeverMind.git
```
in the terminal, in the desired directory. 
This package also requires Eigen, which can be installed from the official website [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) or by typing 
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
```
as usually.

## 🚀 Starting engines
Before starting to build your NN, setting up file paths is necessary. Open the terminal and run
```
python copilot.py initialize
```
then type Eigen's path: `C:/User/.../your_path_to_eigen/Eigen/Dense` (remember to add `Eigen/Dense` and to use `/` to specify sub-directories).  


## 📖 Benchmark
The tests were executed on 500 samples (Hold-out), using an 11th-generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz. Time may vary on different devices.  
| Network size (only hiddens) | Grid size | Iterations | Time (seconds) |
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
| 20x20 | 1 | 1000 | 2.40 |
| 1 x 10 x 1 | 1 | 1000 | 14.83 |
